# What does SpratIOS.xcodeproject do?

The main reason of SpratIOS project has to separate of concerns principle. The main project Smartface.xcworkspace - does not need to hold all the code requires to build Smartface framework.

The main task of SpratIOS project is to be the bridge between Smartface project to framework-core. It does the task via generating its own framework (iOSPlayer.framework).

There are 4 targets used in the project. But actual target is 2 and the other ones is just make it easier to build and move the framework related path of the project.

- **iOSEmulator** - Static Library

- **iOSPlayer** - Static Library

- **iOSEmulatorFinal** - Aggregate

- **iOSPlayerCombined** - Aggregate

## iOS Emulator

it uses to build the framework to work with Smartface Emulator. Smartface Emulator is an application to work with while developing the Smartface projects.

It is required to build the target **iOSEmulatorFinal** in order to build and run Smartface application via Xcode on Smartface.xcworkspace project.

## iOS Player

It uses to build when a Smartface project ready to eject and run as a native application.

It is required to build the target **iOSPlayerCombined** in order to build and run Smartface application via Xcode on Smartface.xcodeproj project.


:::caution
When a fresh clone is done to local machine. Before working with the emulator project(Smartface.xcworkspace), It requires to build `SpratIOS > iOSPlayerFinal` to run. Because it build the iOSEmulator target and make out of it the framework and move to related path.

## How Sprat talk to Framework-Core?

While running the above Aggregate targets, there is a Pre-Actions command for Static targets. It does run the below code

### iOSEmulator Target

```console showLineNumbers
cd "${SOURCE_ROOT}/libs"
./install_corelibraries -i io.smartface.ios:lib-core-emulator:6.8.2-alpha.3;
```
In order to get framework-core project output framework based on the emulator or player.

### iOSPlayer Target

```console showLineNumbers
cd "${SOURCE_ROOT}/libs"
./install_corelibraries -i io.smartface.ios:lib-core:6.8.2-alpha.3;
```
